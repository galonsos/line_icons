# LineIcons

# Just another bunch of beautiful icons to use

I love Material icons. I really do. But, somehow, I suddenly felt tired of them. So I took a look around and found a wonderful set of icons by [Icons8](https://icons8.com/line-awesome). And best of all... for free! (See the [Good Boy Licence](https://icons8.com/good-boy-license/)).

Yeah, what a wonderful world and so on, but, writing down all those nasty codes into Dart constants? No way!

And [FlutterIcon](http://fluttericon.com/) just came out of the blue! It made all the dirty work for me.

I started to use this library in my projects, and they really seemed nice. So I asked to myself: why not publishing it for others to enjoy? After all, in all this process, I was indeed assisted by many people 
who decided not keeping the icons for themselves and helping others with a piece of software they had no need to share with me or anyone else.

So, thank you [Icons8](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) and [FlutterIcon](http://fluttericon.com/)!

## Line, clean, icons

Imagine a cross-over: Windows10 style and Awesome inspiration. Well, stop dreaming! You got plenty of beautiful icons to choose from for your Android app (not tested in iOS yet, sorry). I'd rather like this set over Material, and I find much easier to find the icon I'm looking for in [Icons8](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) than in the [Material Icons page](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline).

## Let's give it a try

**Installing**

Include `line_icons` in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  line_icons: ^0.2.0
```

If your IDE doesn't do it automatically, type:

`flutter packages get`

**Using**

Import the package in your `dart` file and use `Icon` to get the actual icon widget:

```dart
import 'package:line_icons/line_icons.dart';
...
Icon _icon = Icon(LineIcons.code);
...
```
You may also use the "values" property to retrieve a map containing every icon:

```dart
import 'package:line_icons/line_icons.dart';
...
Map<String, IconData> _map = LineIcons.values;
Icon _icon = Icon(_map['code']);
...
```

**Sample**

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:line_icons/line_icons.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Line Icons Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;

  @override
  _MyHomePageState createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}

class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text(
          'Awesome Line icons is great! Take a look at the floating action button :)',
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () => {},
        child: Icon(LineIcons.plus),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
